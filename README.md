# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.     Users are given the option to input the city they wish to analyze it's data.     The python script runs the analysis and returns the analysis result based on the user specifications.
