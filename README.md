# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Users are given the option to input the city they wish to analyze it's data.
The python script runs the analysis and returns the analysis result based on the user specifications.

## Requirements:
- IDE with python interpreter.
- Numpy package
- Panda package

## Installation
If you don't have a working IDE kindly follow this [link](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) to install anaconda on your machine which has all the needed requirements to run the python script.

## Usage
- To analyse a city data, you will be required to enter the city name.
- If you wish to filter the dataset based on month and week day you can specify as required.
- The python script will process the data based on your specifications and return the result of the analysis.
